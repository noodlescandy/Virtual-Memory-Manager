# Virtual Memory Manager
This project was created for an assignment in my COS230 Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
The txt files and interface were not created by me and are included for testing purposes.
This project simulates a memory allocator, allowing a user to allocate and free virtual memory chunks, which was done using Linked Lsts.
